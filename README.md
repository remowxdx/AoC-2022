# Advent of code 20222

This year I don't have much time...
I'll do what I can.

# Day 1

I could do it nearly from the start...
I was awake a little before than normal and had just the
time to solve the task.
Good placement in the leaderboard.

# Day 2

I could do it only in the evening... but has not taken much time.


# Day 3

Like day 1, I was awake.
And broke a glass while getting my laptop in the dark...

# Day 4

Easy problem. Few minutes to solve.

# Day 5

Couldn't solve it the 5th, done the 6th.

Took too much time to parse the input, but I'm happy of the result!

# Day 6

Interesting problem, part 1 and part 2 are almost the same, and I solved
part 1 enough generally to also solve part 2.

# Day 7

I felt at home!!

Shell commands, not enough file space... can't want more!

But it took way too much time, about one hour to find the solutions and
another 20 minutes to refine the script.

# Day 8

Ahhh, messy!

Set the alarm at 6, but wasn't awake enough... lost too much time
to discover that I didn't reset ```visible_from_*``` for every tree and
that I returned ```top * right * left * right``` as scenic score
instead of ```top * bottom * left * right```.


# Day 9

Interesting problem. Didn't understand how to move the tail...
I should read with more attention.

# Day 10

Should remember to add the last line of the display...
Otherwise very fun to implement!

# Day 11

Took much time to set everything up...
And a crysis for the second part...
