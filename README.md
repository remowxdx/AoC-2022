# Advent of code 20222

This year I don't have much time...
I'll do what I can.

# Day 1

I could do it nearly from the start...
I was awake a little before than normal and had just the
time to solve the task.
Good placement in the leaderboard.

# Day 2

I could do it only in the evening... but has not taken much time.


# Day 3

Like day 1, I was awake.
And broke a glass while getting my laptop in the dark...

# Day 4

Easy problem. Few minutes to solve.

# Day 5

Couldn't solve it the 5th, done the 6th.

Took too much time to parse the input, but I'm happy of the result!

# Day 6

Interesting problem, part 1 and part 2 are almost the same, and I solved
part 1 enough generally to also solve part 2.
