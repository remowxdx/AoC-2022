# Advent of code 20222

This year I don't have much time...
I'll do what I can.

# Day 1

I could do it nearly from the start...
I was awake a little before than normal and had just the
time to solve the task.
Good placement in the leaderboard.

# Day 2

I could do it only in the evening... but has not taken much time.


# Day 3

Like day 1, I was awake.
And broke a glass while getting my laptop in the dark...

# Day 4

Easy problem. Few minutes to solve.

# Day 5

Couldn't solve it the 5th, done the 6th.

Took too much time to parse the input, but I'm happy of the result!

# Day 6

Interesting problem, part 1 and part 2 are almost the same, and I solved
part 1 enough generally to also solve part 2.

# Day 7

I felt at home!!

Shell commands, not enough file space... can't want more!

But it took way too much time, about one hour to find the solutions and
another 20 minutes to refine the script.

# Day 8

Ahhh, messy!

Set the alarm at 6, but wasn't awake enough... lost too much time
to discover that I didn't reset ```visible_from_*``` for every tree and
that I returned ```top * right * left * right``` as scenic score
instead of ```top * bottom * left * right```.


# Day 9

Interesting problem. Didn't understand how to move the tail...
I should read with more attention.

# Day 10

Should remember to add the last line of the display...
Otherwise very fun to implement!

# Day 11

Took much time to set everything up...
And a crysis for the second part...

# Day 12

Classic breadth-first-something. I should build a library
and not start implementing every time anew.

# Day 13

I was sick at home.
Took me ages to dicover that there were numbers
made of *two* digits in the input...

Message `[1,2,34]` was translated in `[1,2,3,4]`.

I'm sure that was due to the sickness ;(

# Day 14

I like this "Minecraft-y-like" type of problems!

# Day 15

I was stuck on part 2... Coming home the day after I was struck
by enlightenment and solve right away...

# Day 16

Solved part 1, part 2 takes too much time/memory. Should find another way.

I tried to cheat by downloading two solutions from the 'net... But neither
worked! One gave me the wrong result, the other consumed all my memory
and was killed by the OS.

At the end of the story, I tuned the cache of my solution and waited
about one hour for the result.

# Day 17

Solved part 1, and much later part 2. Ha(r)d to understand the difference between
step for falling rock and step for pushing rock...

# Day 18

Easily solved part 1. Took hours ot solve part 2 with many errors and rewrites...
at the end it was a mistake in finding the bounding of the lava block
(I took the max of the smaller bounding instead of the bigger).

# Day 19

I can't find a quick way to solve this.

# Day 20

At first I thought that I programmed the index operations wrong.
But what was wrong was the display of the decrypted message...

# Day 21

This went almost without problems. First part easy, second part took a little bit
of thinking.
