# Advent of code 20222

This year I don't have much time...
I'll do what I can.

# Day 1

I could do it nearly from the start...
I was awake a little before than normal and had just the
time to solve the task.
Good placement in the leaderboard.

# Day 2

I could do it only in the evening... but has not taken much time.


# Day 3

Like day 1, I was awake.
And broke a glass while getting my laptop in the dark...
